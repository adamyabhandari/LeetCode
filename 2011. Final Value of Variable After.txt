2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations

There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:
++X and X++ increments the value of the variable x by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0.
Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of x after performing all the operations.
Example 1:
Input: operations = ["--X", "X++", "X++'"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The operations are performed as follows:
Initially, X = 0.
--X: X is decremented by 1, X = 0-1 = -1.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 1 + 1 = 0.
X++: X is incremented by 1, X = 0 + 1 = 1.


SOLUTION
class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int x=0;
        for(int i=0;i<operations.length;i++){
            if(operations[i].equals("X++") ||operations[i].equals("++X")){
                x=x+1;
            }
            else
                x-=1; 
        }
        return x;
    }
}
