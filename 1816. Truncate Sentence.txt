1816. Truncate Sentence

A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. Each of the words consists of only uppercase and lowercase English letters (no punctuation).
â€¢ For example, "Hello World", "HELLO", and "hello world hello world" are all sentences.
You are given a sentence s and an integer k. You want to truncate s such that it contains only the first k words. Returns after truncating it.
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4
Output: "Hello how are you"
Explanation: The words in s are ["Hello", "how" "are", "you", "Contestant"]. The first 4 words are ["Hello", "how", "are", "you"]. Hence, you should return "Hello how are you".
Example 2:
Input: s = "What is the solution to this problem", k = 4
Output: "What is the solution"
Explanation:
The words in s are ["What", "is" "the", "solution", "to", "this", "problem"]. The first 4 words are ("What", "is", "the", "solution"]. Hence, you should return "What is the solution"

SOLUTION

class Solution {
    public String truncateSentence(String s, int k) {
        String[] a=s.split(" ");
        //String[] b=new String[k];
        String c="";

        for(int i=0;i<k;i++){
            c+=(a[i]);
            c+=" ";
        }
        return c.trim();
    }
}
