3131. Find the Integer Added to Array I

You are given two arrays of equal length, nums1 and nums2.
Each element in nums 1 has been increased (or decreased in the case of negative) by an integer, represented by the variable x.
As a result, nums 1 becomes equal to nums 2. Two arrays are considered equal when they contain the same integers with the same frequencies.
Return the integer x.
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [2,6,4], nums2 = [9,7,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The integer added to each element of nums 1 is 3.
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [10], nums2 = [5]
Output: -5
Explanation:
The integer added to each element of nums 1 is -5.

SOLUTION

class Solution {
    public int addedInteger(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
        Arrays.sort(nums2);
        return nums2[0]-nums1[0];
    }
}
