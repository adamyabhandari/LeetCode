2000. Reverse Prefix of Word


Given a 0-indexed string word and a character ch, reverse the segment of word that starts at index 0 and ends at the index of the first occurrence of ch (inclusive). If the character ch does not exist in word, do nothing.
â€¢ For example, if word = "abcdefd" and ch = "d", then you should reverse the segment that starts at 0 and ends at 3 (inclusive). The resulting string will be "dcbaefd".
Return the resulting string.
Example 1:
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
Example 2:
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe"


SOLUTION

class Solution {
    public String reversePrefix(String word, char ch) {
        int a=word.indexOf(ch);
        if(a==-1){
            return word;
        }
        StringBuilder b=new StringBuilder(word.substring(0,a+1)).reverse();
        return b+word.substring(a+1);
    }
}
